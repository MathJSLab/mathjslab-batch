MathJSLab Batch is a batch-processing web application built upon the
`mathjslab` package. It initially presents itself as a text box with syntax
highlighting for the MATLAB language.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run build:dev
```

Create a production build:

```sh
npm run build
```

The build uses Eleventy for generated build configuration and Webpack for the
browser bundle. SASS/SCSS is used for global styles and component Shadow DOM
styles.
